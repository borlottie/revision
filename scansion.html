    <h3>Info</h3>
    <p>
      The set lines for 2023 were <strong>Book 6 lines 384-476 and 679-899.</strong> These lines are the most likely lines to be accurate as we just spent a whole semester checking them for errors.<br>
      The set lines for 2024 are <strong>Book 7 lines 323-640.</strong> Only some of these lines are in the site as Mr Wong has not scanned all of them.<br>
      The set lines for 2025 will be <strong>Book 8 lines 407-731.</strong> Only some of these lines are in the site as Mr Wong has not scanned all of them.<br><br>
      
      The scansion solutions for these lines come from Mr Wong's 'VA Scan' spreadsheet which can be found in the omnibus. This can be prone to errors and typos - think incorrect caesuras, wrong 6th feet, etc.<br>
      To get lines added to the site (provided Mr Wong has scanned the lines and put them in his VA scan file) or errors corrected in the site, please contact me via email: sel0010 @ unihigh</p>
    
      <h3>Hypotactic</h3>
    <p><a href="https://hypotactic.com">Hypotactic</a> is a scansion database that has more complete (and potentially more accurate) scansion for all of the Aeneid as well as other Latin works. It's useful to use for lines that Mr Wong hasn't scanned yet, or to understand the scansion of a line more clearly. You can also use it to check that you've put your foot breaks in the right place (i.e. between the right letters). <br><br>
      You can use it to practice scansion for the Aeneid book 7 <a href="https://hypotactic.com/latin/index.html?Use_Id=aen7">here</a>. Other Aeneid books and Latin authors are also available.<br>
      PLEASE NOTE that it doesn't often mark caesuras and doesn't have notes on various exceptions. 
      <br>It also has the 6th foot of every line marked as a spondee which is <strong>incorrect.</strong> <br>
      You'll want to use it with the "Show Macrons" checkbox in the sidebar toggled to off, and the "j/v" checkbox off as well if you like.</p>
    <p>You can use the bookmarklet below (written by me) to view only specific lines instead of the whole book in Hypotactic. Drag this link into your bookmarks bar, and then whenever you're on Hypotactic you can click it to bring up a dialogue letting you choose specific lines to view. <a href='javascript: (() => {for(i in $(".ā").text("a"),$(".ē").text("e"),$(".ī").text("i"),$(".ō").text("o"),$(".ū").text("u"),(macrons=document.getElementById("macrons")).checked&&macrons.removeAttribute("checked"),$(".j").text("i"),$(".v").text("u"),(jv=document.getElementById("jv")).checked&&jv.removeAttribute("checked"),defaultLines="384-476, 679-899","undefined"!=typeof Storage&&localStorage.getItem("showLines")&&(defaultLines=localStorage.getItem("showLines")),toShow=window.prompt(&#39;Lines to show: \nDenote ranges (which are inclusive) with "-" (e.g. "1-10"), and separate multiple lines/ranges with "," (e.g. "1, 3, 5-10").\nThe prescribed lines for 2024 are Aeneid book 7: 323-640.&#39;,defaultLines),"undefined"!=typeof Storage&&localStorage.setItem("showLines",toShow),toShow=toShow.split(","),finalShow=new Set,toShow)if(toShow[i]=toShow[i].trim(),1==(set=toShow[i].split("-")).length)finalShow.add(parseInt(set[0])-1);else{for(j in set)set[j]=parseInt(set[j]);for(let e=set[0];e<=set[1];e++)finalShow.add(e-1)}lines=document.getElementsByClassName("line");for(let l=0;l<lines.length;l++)finalShow.has(l)?(lines[l].style.display="block",lines[l].removeAttribute("data-before"),lines[l].classList.remove("fifth"),lines[l].classList.remove("first")):lines[l].style.display="none";})();'>Hypotactic View Lines</a></p>
    
    <h3>Scansion tips</h3>
    <h4>Last syllables</h4>
    <p>
      Learning to tell the last syllable in a line might seem daunting because it can depend on the grammar of the line, but you'll probably find you won't need to put much effort into it. By the end of the year, you'll know your set lines so well that you'll understand what every word means, and so you'll be able to distinguish between endings such as 1st declension singular nominative and ablative (both -a, but one is short and one is long).<br><br>
      It is, however, useful to learn the lengths of particular endings - while you <em>can</em> find them in the middle of your dictionary, it's useful to be able to know the lengths of common endings off the top of your head.<br>
      Also know that some nouns (especially 3rd declension ones) can look like other declensions -- words like tellus have a long final syllable in the nominative even though the -us looks like it should be short. Check the dictionary to identify words like this@
    </p>

    <h4>Foot breaks</h4>
    <p>
      It's important to place foot breaks in exactly the right place (i.e. between the correct letters). VCAA is a bit flexible on this, but there are still rules to follow. <br>
      Mr Wong's scansion codes which are used in this site don't indicate exactly where a foot break goes, so to check you should use hypotactic (see above). In general, feet should start with a consonant where possible - and elisions between feet usually go at the beginning of the next foot rather than the end of the previous foot.
    </p>

    <h4>Caesuras</h4>
    <p>You can follow this 'priority order' to place caesuras. If none of the places apply, it's possible the line has no caesura -- but it can also indicate you've made a mistake.<br>
      A line can have 2 caesuras or a caesura placed outside of the 'priority order' (e.g. for imagery reasons) but this is rare and will always be mentioned in Mr Wong's notes on the line in the VA scan file (and therefore the notes on the line in this site).
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Strong punctuation in the 2nd, 3rd or 4th foot: Period, semicolon, colon, exclamation mark, question mark, parenthesis, but NOT a comma</li>
      <li>A gap between words in the <strong>3rd</strong> foot (NOT between two short syllables, NOT an elision)</li>
      <li>A gap between words in the <strong>4th</strong> foot (NOT between two short syllables, NOT an elision)</li>
      <li>A gap between words in the <strong>2nd</strong> foot (NOT between two short syllables, NOT an elision)</li>
    </ol>
