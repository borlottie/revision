      <h1>What's this site for?</h1>
      I made this site as an attempt to collect all - or almost all - of my Latin revision under a single tab, rather than needing to have open multiple tabs for each type of revision I want to do. Everything on this site saves your settings for next time for minimal fiddling while you revise. All translations, A&S and Scansion solutions come from Mr Wong.

      <h1>What does this site do?</h1>
      <h3><a href="scansion.html">Scansion</a></h3>
      Allows you to choose lines from the aeneid to scan, then correct all at once or line by line from the same page.
      
      <h3><a href="a-and-s.html">Accidence & Syntax</a></h3>
      Select which poems to include, receive A&S words to account for, and finally correct word by word or all at once.
      Note that this does not currently follow Mr Wong's quotas for parts of speech of the words.
      <h3><a href="seen.html">Seen poetry translations</a></h3>
      Select which poems to include (with a handy word count to help you reach 400 words) and see them in Latin, with the English translations side by side and shown/hidden at your discretion.
