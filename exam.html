      <h1>Exam Resources</h1>
      The Latin exam has 15 minutes of reading time (dictionary use is allowed) and 2 hours of writing time.
      It has 4 sections:
      <ul>
        <li>Unseen -- 45 marks (recommended 50min)</li>
        <li>Comprehension questions -- 15 marks (recommended 15min)</li>
        <li>Literary Technique Questions -- 15 marks (recommended 15min)</li>
        <li>Extended response/Essay -- 20 marks (recommended 35min)</li>
      </ul>
      Information about the various sections such as the types of questions they contain can be found in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VF9Ym88S6AJIVyACeAApCp1BCAGJ0jC8r0cc4Wqo4rI/edit?usp=sharing">Latin Specs Doc</a> as well as tips for each section. Additionally, the Latin Specs Doc also contains a masterlist of literary techniques with information about each.<br><br>
      Additionally, the exam reports from past Latin exams (especially ones within the current curriculum, but past ones are also valuable) contains a lot of information about how to do an exam well -- exam reports typically contain information such as intended essay discussion points, unseen approach recommendations, explanations of what literary techniques were present, and common mistakes students made. Past exams and exam reports extending back to 2002 can be found <a href="https://www.vcaa.vic.edu.au/assessment/vce-assessment/past-examinations/Pages/Latin.aspx">here</a>. This page also includes a sample examination which is good to look at to understand the structure and questions asked in a typical exam under the current curriculum.
      <br><br>
      The current VCAA study design can be found <a href="https://www.vcaa.vic.edu.au/curriculum/vce/vce-study-designs/Latin/Pages/Index.aspx">here</a>. It contains a list of grammar VCAA specifies can be included in unseens, definitions of all the literary techniques VCAA recognises, and other information on the exam and course.
      <h3>Practice Exams</h3>
      Practice exams are hard to come by for Latin. I advise you don't worry too much about them - Mr Wong will source a couple and you'll likely do them in class towards the end of the year. You should, however, find out which previous years' set lines overlapped with yours and avoid seeing any of the content of those years' exams (including unseens) as material from them will likely be part of your practice exams.<br><br>
      While you can't do many practice exams, it is crucial to practice the individual sections of the exam separately.
      <h2>Unseens</h2>
      <h3>Bracketing</h3>
      When completing unseens, it's crucial to bracket -- separate clauses and phrases in an unseen and translate them in a systematic order. This becomes much easier if you use a consistent key to annotate an unseen as you translate. You can find an example one below.
      <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Marking</th>
            <th>Meaning</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Square brackets [ ]</td>
            <td>Sentence (strong punctuation)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Large parentheses ( )</td>
            <td>Clause (e.g. purpose clause, relative clause)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Small parentheses ( )</td>
            <td>Prepositional phrases, Ablative Absolute, and words next to each other that agree</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Double underline</td>
            <td>Main verb (i.e. indicative)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Single underline</td>
            <td>Other verb</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Dashed underline: _ _ _ _</td>
            <td>Subject (nominative)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Dotted underline: .....</td>
            <td>Direct object</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Arrow connecting words</td>
            <td>Possessives</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Underlined last letter in words</td>
            <td>Agreement (for words not next to each other)</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <h3>Sources of unseens</h3>
      There are many unseens on the omnibus which you can use.
      <ul>
        <li>Booklet funseens are a collection of quite easy unseens which Mr Wong will/has given you in class. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZZskJ_S4gvo5agZtqRxqcZ56MM4yyDLX/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=101613233079579845289&rtpof=true&sd=true">Answer doc</a></li><br>

        <li>Dale Unseens are a collection of also easy unseens. There are 60 in total across three documents: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S_yI9tTgNzZ8FCJ4VcQG4jBbMz2HtAMY/view?usp=sharing">1</a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eFMWwJiQdwQUVZM2dJn0KNlH5nj0FBTn/view?usp=sharing">2</a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/159IoJgudNGR5b7Bh_-_IQRoQ5LBCFfYi/view?usp=sharing">3</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14aM0k7nFdsEQv2tKL-NXSQ3pZteHASP9/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=101613233079579845289&rtpof=true&sd=true">Answer doc</a></li><br>
        
        <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1COg7Yj64UmkQPmFIOYtguDGWNxUaGpbE/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=101613233079579845289&rtpof=true&sd=true">Database Unseens</a> are much more difficult. They begin easier than exam unseens, but the later ones are harder than exam unseens. There are 35 unseens in a 'weekly program' and about 18 unseens at the end, although not all of them have translations. For the weekly program, the unseens get harder later in a week, and in later weeks. I recommend completing them in a diagonal pattern (e.g. Week 1 Mon, then Week 1 Tue, then Week 2 Mon, etc). The translations of these unseens aren't very good - many of them are quite loose so it can be difficult to correct.</li><br>

        <li><a href="https://www.vcaa.vic.edu.au/assessment/vce-assessment/past-examinations/Pages/Latin.aspx">Past Exam Unseens</a> are, of course, the best unseens to do in the leadup to the exam. There are 22 past exams with unseens but you will be avoiding a few because they'll be part of practice exams you'll sit. The first 3 years (2002-4) had a different curriculum and have much longer unseens, but they're not difficult. You can get the answers for those from Mr Wong. You can also complete the sample unseen and get the answers from Mr Wong. All other past exam unseens' answers can be found in their exam report, along with suggested bracketing for many. Ration these unseens and plan them out so you complete the last ones (which should be the 2022, 2023 and sample unseens) in the days before the exam.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Comprehension Questions & Literary Techniques</h2>
      This section isn't a big deal. I recommend reading some exam reports to understand expected answers (and amount of detail) for different questions, looking through the sample exam to see the types of questions answered, and ensuring you know what's happening in your set lines (and immediately before and after them).<br><br>
