      <h1>Exam Resources</h1>
      The Latin exam has 15 minutes of reading time (dictionary use is allowed) and 2 hours of writing time.
      It has 4 sections:
      <ul>
        <li>Unseen -- 45 marks (recommended 50min)</li>
        <li>Comprehension questions -- 15 marks (recommended 15min)</li>
        <li>Literary Technique Questions -- 15 marks (recommended 15min)</li>
        <li>Extended response/Essay -- 20 marks (recommended 35min)</li>
      </ul>
      Information about the various sections such as the types of questions they contain can be found in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VF9Ym88S6AJIVyACeAApCp1BCAGJ0jC8r0cc4Wqo4rI/edit?usp=sharing">Latin Specs Doc</a> as well as tips for each section. Additionally, the Latin Specs Doc also contains a masterlist of literary techniques with information about each.<br><br>
      Additionally, the exam reports from past Latin exams (especially ones within the current curriculum, but past ones are also valuable) contains a lot of information about how to do an exam well -- exam reports typically contain information such as intended essay discussion points, unseen approach recommendations, explanations of what literary techniques were present, and common mistakes students made. Past exams and exam reports extending back to 2002 can be found <a href="https://www.vcaa.vic.edu.au/assessment/vce-assessment/past-examinations/Pages/Latin.aspx">here</a>. This page also includes a sample examination which is good to look at to understand the structure and questions asked in a typical exam under the current curriculum.
      <br><br>
      The current VCAA study design can be found <a href="https://www.vcaa.vic.edu.au/curriculum/vce/vce-study-designs/Latin/Pages/Index.aspx">here</a>. It contains a list of grammar VCAA specifies can be included in unseens, definitions of all the literary techniques VCAA recognises, and other information on the exam and course.
      <h3>Practice Exams</h3>
      Practice exams are hard to come by for Latin. I advise you don't worry too much about them - Mr Wong will source a couple and you'll likely do them in class towards the end of the year. You should, however, find out which previous years' set lines overlapped with yours and avoid seeing any of the content of those years' exams (including unseens) as material from them will likely be part of your practice exams.<br><br>
      While you can't do many practice exams, it is crucial to practice the individual sections of the exam separately.
      <h2>Unseens</h2>
      Doing unseens regularly is key to doing well. Aim to complete all of the past exam unseens (perhaps excluding the pre-2005 ones which were longer) in the leadup to the exam. I recommend weekly or biweekly unseens on top of that.
      <h3>Bracketing</h3>
      When completing unseens, it's crucial to bracket -- separate clauses and phrases in an unseen and translate them in a systematic order. This becomes much easier if you use a consistent key to annotate an unseen as you translate. You can find an example one below.
      <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Marking</th>
            <th>Meaning</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Square brackets [ ]</td>
            <td>Sentence (strong punctuation)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Large parentheses ( )</td>
            <td>Clause (e.g. purpose clause, relative clause)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Small parentheses ( )</td>
            <td>Prepositional phrases, Ablative Absolute, and words next to each other that agree</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Double underline</td>
            <td>Main verb (i.e. indicative)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Single underline</td>
            <td>Other verb</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Dashed underline: _ _ _ _</td>
            <td>Subject (nominative)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Dotted underline: .....</td>
            <td>Direct object</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Arrow connecting words</td>
            <td>Possessives</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Underlined last letter in words</td>
            <td>Agreement (for words not next to each other)</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <h3>Sources of unseens</h3>
      There are many unseens on the omnibus which you can use.
      <ul>
        <li>Booklet funseens are a collection of quite easy unseens which Mr Wong will/has given you in class. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZZskJ_S4gvo5agZtqRxqcZ56MM4yyDLX/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=101613233079579845289&rtpof=true&sd=true">Answer doc</a></li><br>

        <li>Dale Unseens are a collection of also easy unseens. There are 60 in total across three documents: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S_yI9tTgNzZ8FCJ4VcQG4jBbMz2HtAMY/view?usp=sharing">1</a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eFMWwJiQdwQUVZM2dJn0KNlH5nj0FBTn/view?usp=sharing">2</a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/159IoJgudNGR5b7Bh_-_IQRoQ5LBCFfYi/view?usp=sharing">3</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14aM0k7nFdsEQv2tKL-NXSQ3pZteHASP9/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=101613233079579845289&rtpof=true&sd=true">Answer doc</a></li><br>
        
        <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1COg7Yj64UmkQPmFIOYtguDGWNxUaGpbE/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=101613233079579845289&rtpof=true&sd=true">Database Unseens</a> are much more difficult. They begin easier than exam unseens, but the later ones are harder than exam unseens. There are 35 unseens in a 'weekly program' and about 18 unseens at the end, although not all of them have translations. For the weekly program, the unseens get harder later in a week, and in later weeks. I recommend completing them in a diagonal pattern (e.g. Week 1 Mon, then Week 1 Tue, then Week 2 Mon, etc). The translations of these unseens aren't very good - many of them are quite loose so it can be difficult to correct.</li><br>

        <li><a href="https://www.vcaa.vic.edu.au/assessment/vce-assessment/past-examinations/Pages/Latin.aspx">Past Exam Unseens</a> are, of course, the best unseens to do in the leadup to the exam. There are 22 past exams with unseens but you will be avoiding a few because they'll be part of practice exams you'll sit. The first 3 years (2002-4) had a different curriculum and have much longer unseens, but they're not difficult. You can get the answers for those from Mr Wong. You can also complete the sample unseen and get the answers from Mr Wong. All other past exam unseens' answers can be found in their exam report, along with suggested bracketing for many. Ration these unseens and plan them out so you complete the last ones (which should be the 2022, 2023 and sample unseens) in the days before the exam.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Comprehension Questions & Literary Techniques</h2>
      This section isn't a big deal. I recommend reading some exam reports to understand expected answers (and amount of detail) for different questions, looking through the sample exam to see the types of questions answered, and ensuring you know what's happening in your set lines (and immediately before and after them).<br><br>
      <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VF9Ym88S6AJIVyACeAApCp1BCAGJ0jC8r0cc4Wqo4rI/edit?usp=sharing">Latin Specs Doc</a> is a very useful document explaining the VCAA definitions of all the literary techniques, with examples of previous times they've been used in exams (if at all -- some techniques are very unlikely to appear in exams!). <br><br>It also showcases the kinds of questions and knowlege or skills required in these sections. For instance, you will need to know what occurs immediately before and after your set lines, and you will need to know who is speaking at all times. You will also want to at least vaguely know who everyone in Mr Wong's proper nouns sheet is, and be able to explain where any tribes/groups of people mentioned reside. For more examples like this of what you'll want to know, <em>read through past exams to see the questions asked and look at their exam reports to see what was expected knowledge!!!</em> (such a wide range of questions are asked in these sections that it's difficult to list all the types/required knowledge.)
      <h3>Familiarity with your set lines</h3>
      <strong>Even if the comprehension questions and lit techs section isn't a big deal, having a strong understanding of the set lines is one of the first things you should be doing to revise!!!! It's crucial for all of part B (comprehension questions, lit techs, essay) and not difficult. It will make your life much easier if you start early.</strong>
      It is absolutely crucial to have a strong understanding of your set lines. The comprehension questions, literary technique questions, and essay all rely heavily on you understanding what's happening in your set lines. While you don't need to be able to recite your set lines or know word for word what they mean, you <em>will</em> need to be able to accurately translate sections of interest (for instance particularly meaningful examples of literary techniques) and know what's going on at any given point in the passage.<br><br>
      
      I've found the easiest way to do this is to print out the set lines and read them out loud regularly (I read half the set lines each day) for a while. It could take 4-6 weeks to nail down the translation, because of the length. You'll also want to check every now and then whether you can recite/translate the English seeing only the Latin.<br><br>

      Do also make sure to understand the translation and how the Latin works - this will help you enormously with scansion (you'll be able to look up what length endings are in your dictionary) and explaining literary techniques in your essay (you'll be able to provide exactly the relevant latin words, which the examiners prefer). I typically do this by going over the Latin line by line, attempting to translate a line word for word (hovering my mouse over each word as I translate it) and looking up any words I don't remember as I go. This is slow, but very valuable.

      <h2>Essay</h2>
      A large part of your essay revision will just be understanding the content of your set lines, ensuring familiarity with the literary techniques used, and thinking about the most prominent themes.<br>
      <h3>Practice essay questions</h3>
      If you want to write practice essays, you'll probably have to write your own exam questions. I've found the easiest way to do this is to look at past exams either focusing on the same book (but using different set lines - any past exams with the same set lines should be saved to complete in one go as a practice exam) or using the same curriculum and use them to write similar exam questions for your own set lines.<br><br>
      As the year goes on you will begin to get a feel for which sections of your set lines lend themselves more to essays (and the same for comprehension and lit techs questions). <br>
      You also probably won't need to do very many practice essays -- 3-4 on top of the essay SAC and practice exams you do is plenty.
      <h3>Structuring an essay</h3>
      Latin essays are different to English essays. Staying on topic with regards to the prompt is much more important! You need to be direct and stay on topic the entire time. You may want to mention examples that aren't very relevant to try to use more latin or show you understand the context, but avoid doing so -- you will be marked down for not staying on topic.<br>
      Part A of the essay (the short question) should be 1 or maybe 2 paragraphs. Don't go overboard -- save your time. Explain whatever you are asked and then move on.<br>
      Part B of the essay (the actual essay) should be a full, if short, essay. Include a short introduction (it can be just your contention) and three body paragraphs in a logical order which are clearly linked to the prompt, contention, and each other. A conclusion isn't really necessary.<br><br>
      Body paragraphs should more or less follow the TEEL structure -- clear topic sentence, provide evidence in latin, explain it, and then link to the next paragraph. Make sure to back up most of your points with latin -- if you include no or very little latin, you can only get about half marks for your entire essay!!!!!.
